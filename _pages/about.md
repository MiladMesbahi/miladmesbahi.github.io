Hello! I’m Milad Mesbahi.

I’m a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania (Class of 2026), with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA. I’m currently seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026, which would allow me to further explore and grapple with the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and optimization. 

Research Interests
======
I’m driven by the puzzle of what makes a system genuinely intelligent. A slime-mold can trace the shortest path through a maze without a signle neuron. An ant colony, through pheromone-based feedback, can adapt routes in real time and distribute labor, all without centralized control. Even a dodder plant, a parasitic vine, can continously perform exploration vs. exploitation decision-making among potential hosts by detecting airborne chemicals, effectively performing multi-sensory optimization with no nervous system.

These examples fascinate me because they challenge our anthropocentric view of intelligence. They show that purposeful behavior can emerge from simple rules, local sensing, and distributed control. This is the foundation of my interest in robotics and autonomous systems: building machines that reason, adapt, and act intelligently in the real world.

**Fundamentally, I would like to ask:**

- How can systems learn, adapt, and stay reliable in unstructured environments?

- How can agents make decisions that are real-time, dynamics-aware, and robust under uncertainty?

- How can we rethink the structure of a problem — its geometry, dimensionality, dynamics — to make complexity tractable?

- How can groups of agents cooperate safely to yield utilitarian outcomes, even when they don’t fully trust each other or share the same goals?

Through doctoral research, these are the kind of high-level questions I would love to address.

Philosophy
======
My overarching mission with my life is to serve Earth and empower the communities that sustain it. As both an aspiring researcher, future entreprenuer, and young adult, success in my life will be defined by the purpose and integrity of my work, the strength and depth of my relationships, and my ability to help build a better and more sustainable world.
