Hello! I’m Milad Mesbahi.

I’m a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania (Class of 2026), with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA. I’m currently seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026 to further explore the frontiers where machine learning, control, and optimization intersect with intelligent systems.

====== 
What really motivates me to pursue a PhD lies in the challenges that come with designing systems that make robust, intelligent decisions. Some models of the world are elegantly simple yet surprisingly effective; others are utterly complex but fail to capture what truly matters. I’m fascinated by that tension. I would like to apply mathematical principles to engineer embedded intelligence in agents and systems, following nature's lead of adaptability and efficiency.


**Fundamentally:**

- How can we embed adaptability and resilience into systems & agents constrained by resources, operating in imperfect conditions? 

- How do we make real-time decisions that are safe, efficient, and grounded in uncertainty?

- How can we rethink the structure of a problem — its geometry, dimensionality, dynamics — to make complexity tractable?

- How can groups of agents cooperate safely to yield utilitarian outcomes, even when they don’t fully trust each other or share the same goals?

Through doctoral research, these are the kind of high-level questions I would love to solve.

Philosophy

My overarching mission with my life is to serve Earth and empower the communities that sustain it. As both an aspiring researcher, future entreprenuer, and young adult, success in my life will be defined by the purpose and integrity of my work, the strength and depth of my relationships, and my ability to help build a better and more sustainable world.
