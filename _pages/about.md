Hello! I’m Milad Mesbahi.

I’m a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania (graduating 2026) with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA. I am seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026, focusing on control theory, machine learning, and optimization.

Research Interests
======
I'm driven by a desire to tackle the world's most pressing, systemic issues. Technically, I am particularly interested in how we make decisions in complex, networked systems; where uncertainty, real-world constraints, and nonlinear dynamics make finding optimal policies deeply challenging.

**Fundamentally:**

- How can we design resilient control and decision-making for large, uncertain systems? 

- How can we balance performance, safety, and efficiency trade-offs in real-time optimization for interconnected networks using probabilistic frameworks?

- How can we model and exploit network interdependencies for high-dimensional systems?

- How can distributed agents achieve safe, pro-social cooperation despite adversarial or conflicting objectives and limited communication?

Through doctoral research, these are the kind of high-level questions I would love to solve.

Philosophy
======
My overarching mission with my education is to serve Earth and empower the communities that sustain it. As both an aspiring researcher and young adult, success in my life will be defined by the purpose and integrity of my work, the strength of my relationships, and my ability to help build a more just and sustainable world.

What Else
======
This site also includes a reading journal I started in 2025 — short reflections on every book I’ve read since the beginning of the year. I update it regularly and always welcome new recommendations.
