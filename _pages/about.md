Hi, I’m Milad Mesbahi, a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania (graduating May 2026) with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA (2024). I am seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026, focusing on control theory, machine learning, and optimization.

Currently, I’m a GNC Graduate Intern at Blue Origin, analyzing engine control systems. My past experience includes a NASA JPL internship, research in UCLA’s Thermodynamics Lab with Dr. Sungtaek Ju, and launching a social networking app that reached over 4,000 UCLA students.


At UPenn, I conduct research in Dr. George Pappas’s lab, focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning for autonomous underwater vehicles mapping dynamic river-ocean plumes. My work benchmarks state-of-the-art RL methods against an adapted, physics-informed dual deep Q-network that accounts for environmental dynamics and strict computational and communication constraints. Our approach has shown promising results in enabling efficient, accurate mapping of complex, spatio-temporal environments.

Research Interests
======
I'm fascinated by the challenge of decision-making in complex, networked systems; where uncertainty, real-world constraints, and nonlinear dynamics all collide. 

**Fundamentally:**
- How can we design scalable control and decision-making algorithms for complex, nonlinear networked systems operating under uncertainty and real-world constraints?

- What are the fundamental trade-offs between performance, safety, and resilience in large-scale, interconnected networks, and how can these be optimized in real time?

- How can distributed agents coordinate efficiently and adaptively, even with limited communication and heterogeneous capabilities, while guaranteeing system-level safety?

- In what ways can we model and leverage the interdependence of complex systems as an advantage for control and optimization, rather than a source of fragility?

Through doctoral research, I aim to bridge theory and practice, advancing tools in control, optimization, and machine learning to build systems that are as resilient as they are impactful.

Philosophy
======
To me, engineering isn’t just about solving technical problems — it’s about serving life on Earth and empowering the communities that sustain it. I measure personal success by the strength of my relationships, the purpose and integrity of my work, and my ability to help build a more just and sustainable world.

As both an aspiring researcher and human being, the ethos of my actions are centered on a valued balance: ambition with humility, rigor with gratitude, and discipline with compassion. 

And I hope to inspire others do the same.

What Else
======
This site also includes a reading journal I started in 2025 — short reflections on every book I’ve read since the beginning of the year. I update it regularly and always welcome new recommendations.
