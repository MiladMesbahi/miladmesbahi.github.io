Hi, I’m Milad Mesbahi — a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating May 2026. I hold a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA (2024), and I’m currently seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026 focused on control theory, machine learning, and optimization.

Right now, I’m a GNC Graduate Intern at Blue Origin, working on control systems analysis for the Engines team. Previously, I interned at NASA JPL, conducted research in UCLA’s Thermodynamics Lab under Dr. Sungtaek Ju, and now contribute to multi-agent reinforcement learning research in Dr. George Pappas’s lab at Penn.

Research Focus
======


Philosophy
======
To me, engineering isn’t just about solving technical problems — it’s about serving people. In a world shaped by overlapping social, political, economic, and environmental forces, I believe engineers have a responsibility to lead with empathy, not just algorithms.

What Else
======
This site also includes a reading journal I started in 2024 — short reflections on every book I’ve read since the beginning of the year. I update it regularly and always welcome new recommendations.
