Hello! I’m Milad Mesbahi.

I'm currently a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania (Class of 2026), with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA. I’m in the midst of applying for PhD positions starting Fall 2026, which would enable me to further explore the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and optimization within the context of autonomous systems. 

Research Interests
======
What makes something truly intelligent? 

Consider the slime mold. Without a single neuron, it can navigate a maze to find the shortest path to food.  Ant colonies orchestrate intricate societies and optimize resource allocation with no CEO, no org charts, no LinkedIn. The octopus distributes nearly two-thirds of its neurons throughout its arms, effectively parallelizing decision-making. Plants don't have brains, yet they've dominated evolution and make up 80% of Earth's biomass.

I believe these biological organisms reveal something profound and upend our anthropocentric view of intelligence. Purposeful behavior can emerge from simple rules, local information, and distributed control, all grounded in physical interaction with the environment. Intelligence, in this broader sense, isn’t housed in a brain or algorithmic abstraction, but rather an embodied property of systems able to sense, respond, and self-organize. 

This is the foundation of my PhD research interests: building agents that reason, adapt, and act intelligently in the real world.

**Fundamentally, I would like to ask:**

- How can systems learn and adapt while remaining reliable in unstructured, dynamic environments?

- How can agents make decisions that respect real-time constraints, physical dynamics, and fundamental uncertainty? Can we produce formal mathematical guarantees?

- How can we continue to bridge model-based control and learning-based approaches to get the best of both worlds?

- How can groups of agents cooperate safely and efficiently, even with conflicting objectives or imperfect information?

- How can we enable effective real-world learning that closes the sim-to-real gap and allows robots to improve through environmental interaction?

Through doctoral research, these are the kind of high-level questions I would love to address.

Philosophy
======
 The technologies we build should serve the planet and the people who depend on it. As both an aspiring researcher, future entreprenuer, and young adult, success in my life will be defined by the purpose and integrity of my work with respect to my values, the strength and depth of my relationships, and my ability to help build a more just and sustainable world.
