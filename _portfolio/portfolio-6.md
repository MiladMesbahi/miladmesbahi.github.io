### MEMS-Based Micro-Mirror System  
Designed and optimized a MEMS micro-mirror with one translational degree of freedom for high-precision optical modulation.

#### Key Features

- **Design Approach**:
  - Applied the FACT (Freedom and Constraint Topologies) framework to build a compliant mechanism with six wire flexures.
  - Integrated two parallel plate actuators to enable vertical displacement with minimal parasitic motion.
  - Achieved ~125 Âµm maximum displacement for fine control.

- **Modeling & Simulation**:
  - Developed stiffness matrix models in MATLAB.
  - Verified performance and modal isolation through Finite Element Analysis (FEA).
  - Ensured primary resonance at ~2.5 kHz with higher modes >15Ã— above.

- **Fabrication Plan**:
  - Designed for microfabrication via Deep Reactive-Ion Etching (DRIE) and photolithography.
  - Included aluminum sputtering for electrode definition and mirror reflectivity.
  - Analyzed electrostatic pull-in thresholds to avoid instability.

- **Applications**:
  - Suitable for adaptive optics, laser modulation, and compact optical systems.
  - Prioritized speed, precision, and energy efficiency in micro-scale design.
