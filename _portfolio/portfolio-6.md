### Highlights
- Used the FACT framework to design a six-wire flexure mechanism with parallel plate actuators, enabling precise vertical motion (~125 µm max) with low parasitic error.
- Modeled stiffness and modal isolation in MATLAB; confirmed high resonance (2.5 kHz+) via FEA.
- Developed a DRIE and lithography-friendly fabrication plan, including aluminum sputtered electrodes and pull-in analysis.
- Positioned for adaptive optics and laser systems with a focus on speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency.
