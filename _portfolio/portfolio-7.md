### Key Contributions

- **Experimental Design & Execution**
  - Designed and built custom setups to control and measure **tension** in cotton strings, including 3D printed and laser cut parts through the UCLA maker space.  
  - Ran stress tests to analyze how tension affects **bead formation, motion, spacing, and velocity**  
  - Highlighted a previously overlooked variable (string tension) that did have an impact on fluid flow.

- **Automation & Analysis**
  - Developed **MATLAB image processing algorithms** to capture string curvature and automate droplet tracking  
  - Enabled faster, more consistent quantification of fluid behavior across multiple trials
  - Helped create lab tutorial videos for future researchers to use for reference.
