**ICRA-26 submission under review**

This research focuses on developing collaborative multi-agent learning algorithms and adaptive control strategies for autonomous underwater vehicles to efficiently perform long-term spatiotemporal mapping in dynamic, resource-constrained settings. The work integrates data-driven models with energy-aware decision-making to improve mission endurance and mapping accuracy in complex real-world environments. We have one paper published on arXiv and currently under review at ICRA 2026, demonstrating how multi-agent reinforcement learning combined with Gaussian process regression enables coordinated AUV fleets to map river plumes over multiple days while balancing estimation accuracy and energy efficiency.

Current extensions include: (1) developing 3D mapping capabilities to capture volumetric underwater structure, (2) hardware deployment by interfacing RL policies with low-level vehicle control and bridging the sim-to-real gap, (3) replacing Gaussian process regression with neural operators for more scalable spatiotemporal modeling, and (4) parallel theoretical work on multi-agent communication strategies using Jumanji and MAVA environments.
