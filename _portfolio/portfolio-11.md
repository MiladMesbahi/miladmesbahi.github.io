#### Key Contributions

- **Manual Machining**:
  - Hands-on experience with lathes and milling machines.
  - Learned to measure precisely, select proper feed rates, and prevent tool/workpiece damage.
  - Adapted to challenges like overcutting and misalignment through real-time problem solving.

- **CNC Machining**:
  - Programmed toolpaths using SolidCAM and wrote G-code for efficient machining.
  - Minimized tool changes and machining time through optimized sequencing.
  - Calibrated equipment and ensured alignment for tight-tolerance parts.
