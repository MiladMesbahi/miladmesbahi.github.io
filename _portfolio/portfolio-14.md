At **Blue Origin**, I developed a high-fidelity Simulink reference model for the electromechanical actuation of an upper stage rocket engine. The model spans from detailed plant dynamics to cascaded control loops ready for direct deployment to hardware.

### Highlights

- Designed and implemented cascaded position and current controllers with Field-Oriented Control (FOC) logic  
- Built a dynamic plant model capturing electrical, mechanical, and non-linear effects to closely mirror actual system behavior  
- Conducted various command profiles (step, staircase, sinuosidal, chirp), frequency, and transient response testing to validate performance and guide hardware integration
- Integrated auto-code generating C code scripts and evolved model to ensure hardware compatability 

### Impact
- Delivered end-to-end EMA simulation framework for rocket engine valves   
- Documented all work and research for company propietary use
- Established a foundation platform for future propulsion system electrification efforts at Blue
