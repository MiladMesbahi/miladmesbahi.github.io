BOWL (Bayesian Optimization for Wide Landscapes) seeks robust optima‚Äîwide, flat basins that remain near-optimal under perturbations by combining Entropy-SGD with an MPD gradient oracle to guide black-box exploration.

### Highlights

- Hybrid local-entropy objective steers search toward flat regions.  
- MPD oracle (\(v^* \propto -\Sigma^{-1}\mu\)) picks descent directions from the GP posterior.  
- Benchmarks (Hartmann-3D, Levy, Branin) show faster convergence and improved robustness against noise.

### Limitations

- Not yet peer-reviewed‚Äîstill in preprint form.  
- High computational cost from the inner Entropy-SGD loop.  
- Sensitive to tuning of Langevin-step sizes and GP update frequency.
