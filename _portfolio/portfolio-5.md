Built a 1-pound combat robot as a two-person team, designed to balance destructive force and structural durability. Placed **2nd** in a student competition.

### Highlights

- Structure:
  - Machined high-strength aluminum chassis
  - Designed for ideal strength-to-weight ratio
  - Reinforced using FEA and center of mass analysis

- Weapon:
  - “Egg beater” drum spinner
  - Accounted for ~30% of total mass
  - Tuned for high impact undercuts

- Electronics:
  - Bluetooth manual control
  - Shielded internals for shock resistance

- Performance:
  - Survived repeated impacts with minimal damage
  - Improved iteratively using FEM and physical testing
