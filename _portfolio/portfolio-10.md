My very first college project! Built a working guitar tuner from scratch using physics, Python, and Arduino. I used a microphone to capture string vibrations, then analyzed signals to identify notes.

### Highlights
- Captured real-time guitar sounds with Arduino and a microphone.
- Wrote Python code to apply FFTs and extract string frequencies.
- Achieved good note detection, though the lowest string, E (82.4 Hz), was often slightly flat.
