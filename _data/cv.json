I recently completed an internship at Blue Origin as a GNC engineer for their engines team, and I am currently researching multi-agent RL in the context of spatiotemporal mapping under Dr. George Pappas. Previous experiences include an internship at NASA JPL, fluid dynamics research at UCLA under Dr. Sungtaek Ju, and co-founding a social networking platform at UCLA that grew to 4000 students. Applying for PhD programs starting Fall 2026.",
