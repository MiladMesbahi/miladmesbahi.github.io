    "summary": "Robotics master’s student at UPenn interested in how learning and control combine to produce adaptive, reliable behavior in the physical world. I’m drawn to questions regarding how systems can generalize, reason under incomplete information, and act safely in dynamic environments. My end-to-end experiences span across the full autonomy stack, and I aim to develop hybrid learning–control frameworks that bridge high-level reasoning with verifiable low-level execution. I’m pursuing PhD programs starting Fall 2026.",
